### Description

yum-rhn-plugin in Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 5 does not verify the SSL certificate for a file download from a Red Hat Network (RHN) server, which makes it easier for remote man-in-the-middle attackers to cause a denial of service (loss of updates) or force the download and installation of official Red Hat packages that were not requested.
