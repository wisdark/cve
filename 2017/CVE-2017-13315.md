### Description

In writeToParcel and createFromParcel of DcParamObject.java, there is a permission bypass due to a write size mismatch. This could lead to an elevation of privileges where the user can start an activity with system privileges, with no additional execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.
