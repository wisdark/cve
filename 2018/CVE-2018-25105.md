### Description

The  File Manager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authorization bypass due to a missing capability check in the /inc/root.php file in versions up to, and including, 3.0. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to download arbitrary files from the server and upload arbitrary files that can be used for remote code execution.
