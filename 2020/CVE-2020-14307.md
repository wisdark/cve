### Description

A vulnerability was found in Wildfly's Enterprise Java Beans (EJB) versions shipped with Red Hat JBoss EAP 7, where SessionOpenInvocations are never removed from the remote InvocationTracker after a response is received in the EJB Client, as well as the server. This flaw allows an attacker to craft a denial of service attack to make the service unavailable.
