### Description

When ORT (now via atstccfg) generates ip_allow.config files in Apache Traffic Control 3.0.0 to 3.1.0 and 4.0.0 to 4.1.0, those files include permissions that allow bad actors to push arbitrary content into and remove arbitrary content from CDN cache servers. Additionally, these permissions are potentially extended to IP addresses outside the desired range, resulting in them being granted to clients possibly outside the CDN arcitechture.
