### Description

The Timetable and Event Schedule by MotoPress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authorization bypass due to a missing capability check on the wp_ajax_route_url() function called via a nopriv AJAX action in versions up to, and including, 2.3.8. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to call that function and perform a wide variety of actions such as including random template, injecting malicious web scripts, and more.
