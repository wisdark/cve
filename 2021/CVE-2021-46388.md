### Description

** DISPUTED ** WAGO 750-8212 PFC200 G2 2ETH RS Firmware version 03.05.10(17) is affected by a privilege escalation vulnerability. Improper handling of user cookies leads to escalating privileges to administrative account of the router. NOTE: analysis by a security team (on behalf of the vendor) indicates that an attacker could only view data that is already publicly available, could not modify data, and could not obtain other access or interfere with the operation of the device.
