### Description

The myCred WordPress plugin before 2.4.4 does not have any authorisation and CSRF checks in the mycred-tools-import-export AJAX action, allowing any authenticated users, such as subscribers, to call it and import mycred setup, thus creating badges, managing points or creating arbitrary posts.
