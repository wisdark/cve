### Description

A vulnerability in the certificate validation of Cisco&nbsp;Expressway-C and Cisco&nbsp;TelePresence VCS could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to gain unauthorized access to sensitive data.&nbsp;&nbsp;The vulnerability is due to a lack of validation of the SSL server certificate that an affected device receives when it establishes a connection to a Cisco&nbsp;Unified Communications Manager device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by using a man-in-the-middle technique to intercept the traffic between the devices, and then using a self-signed certificate to impersonate the endpoint. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to view the intercepted traffic in clear text or alter the contents of the traffic.Note: Cisco&nbsp;Expressway-E is not affected by this vulnerability.Cisco&nbsp;has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.
