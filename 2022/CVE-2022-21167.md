### Description

All versions of package masuit.tools.core are vulnerable to Arbitrary Code Execution via the ReceiveVarData<T> function in the SocketClient.cs component. The socket client in the package can pass in the payload via the user-controllable input after it has been established, because this socket client transmission does not have the appropriate restrictions or type bindings for the BinaryFormatter.
