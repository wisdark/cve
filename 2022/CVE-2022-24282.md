### Description

A vulnerability has been identified in SINEC NMS (All versions < V1.0.3), SINEC NMS (All versions >= V1.0.3). The affected system allows to upload JSON objects that are deserialized to Java objects. Due to insecure deserialization of user-supplied content by the affected software, a privileged attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a maliciously crafted serialized Java object. This could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the device with root privileges.
