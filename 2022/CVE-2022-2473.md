### Description

The WP-UserOnline plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the â€˜templates[browsingpage][text]' parameter in versions up to, and including, 2.87.6 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping.

The only affects multi-site installations and installations where unfiltered_html is disabled.
