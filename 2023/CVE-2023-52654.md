### Description

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:io_uring/af_unix: disable sending io_uring over socketsFile reference cycles have caused lots of problems for io_uringin the past, and it still doesn't work exactly right and races withunix_stream_read_generic(). The safest fix would be to completelydisallow sending io_uring files via sockets via SCM_RIGHT, so thereare no possible cycles invloving registered files and thus renderingSCM accounting on the io_uring side unnecessary.
