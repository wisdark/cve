### Description

Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer vulnerability in Arm Ltd Valhall GPU Firmware, Arm Ltd Arm 5th Gen GPU Architecture Firmware allows a local non-privileged user to make improper GPU processing operations to access a limited amount outside of buffer bounds. If the operations are carefully prepared, then this in turn could give them access to all system memory. This issue affects Valhall GPU Firmware: from r29p0 through r46p0; Arm 5th Gen GPU Architecture Firmware: from r41p0 through r46p0.
