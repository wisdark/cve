### Description

A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco ATA 190 Series Analog Telephone Adapter firmware could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to modify the configuration or reboot an affected device.This vulnerability is due to the HTTP server allowing state changes in GET requests. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malicious request to the web-based management interface on an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to make limited modifications to the configuration or reboot the device, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.&nbsp;
