### Description

A vulnerability in Internet Key Exchange version 2 (IKEv2) processing of Cisco Secure Client Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) of Cisco Secure Client. This vulnerability is due to an integer underflow condition. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted IKEv2 packet to an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause Cisco Secure Client Software to crash, resulting in a DoS condition on the client software. Note: Cisco Secure Client Software releases 4.10 and earlier were known as Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client.
