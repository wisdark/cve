### Description

A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Evolved Programmable Network Manager (EPNM) and Cisco Prime Infrastructure could allow an authenticated, low-privileged, remote attacker to conduct a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the interface.This vulnerability exists because the web-based management interface does not properly validate user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by injecting malicious code into a specific page of the interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive browser-based information. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must have at least a low-privileged account on an affected device.
