### Description

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:md/raid5: fix deadlock that raid5d() wait for itself to clear MD_SB_CHANGE_PENDINGXiao reported that lvm2 test lvconvert-raid-takeover.sh can hang withsmall possibility, the root cause is exactly the same as commitbed9e27baf52 ("Revert "md/raid5: Wait for MD_SB_CHANGE_PENDING in raid5d"")However, Dan reported another hang after that, and junxiao investigatedthe problem and found out that this is caused by plugged bio can't issuefrom raid5d().Current implementation in raid5d() has a weird dependence:1) md_check_recovery() from raid5d() must hold 'reconfig_mutex' to clear   MD_SB_CHANGE_PENDING;2) raid5d() handles IO in a deadloop, until all IO are issued;3) IO from raid5d() must wait for MD_SB_CHANGE_PENDING to be cleared;This behaviour is introduce before v2.6, and for consequence, if othercontext hold 'reconfig_mutex', and md_check_recovery() can't updatesuper_block, then raid5d() will waste one cpu 100% by the deadloop, until'reconfig_mutex' is released.Refer to the implementation from raid1 and raid10, fix this problem byskipping issue IO if MD_SB_CHANGE_PENDING is still set aftermd_check_recovery(), daemon thread will be woken up when 'reconfig_mutex'is released. Meanwhile, the hang problem will be fixed as well.
