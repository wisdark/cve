### Description

Due to weak encoding of user-controlled inputs, eProcurement on SAP S/4HANA allows malicious scripts to be executed in the application, potentially leading to a Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. This has no impact on the availability of the application, but it can have some minor impact on its confidentiality and integrity.
