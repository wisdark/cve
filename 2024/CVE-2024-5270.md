### Description

Mattermost versions 9.5.x <= 9.5.3, 9.7.x <= 9.7.1, 9.6.x <= 9.6.1 and 8.1.x <= 8.1.12 fail to check if the email signup configuration option is enabled when a user requests to switch from SAML to Email. This allows the user to switch their authentication mail from SAML to email and possibly edit personal details that were otherwise non-editable and provided by the SAML provider.
