### Description

The User Feedback â€“ Create Interactive Feedback Form, User Surveys, and Polls in Seconds plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the name parameter in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.15 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in feedback form responses that will execute whenever a high-privileged user tries to view them.
