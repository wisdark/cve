### Description

The WordPress File Upload plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Path Traversal in all versions up to, and including, 4.24.11 via wfu_file_downloader.php. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to read or delete files outside of the originally intended directory. Successful exploitation requires the targeted WordPress installation to be using PHP 7.4 or earlier.
